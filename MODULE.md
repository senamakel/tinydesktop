# tinydesktop TinyBus Module

This package contains the native `tinydesktop` module for TinyBus module ABI
v1. Install only the archive matching the host operating system and
architecture.

The module claims `ai.tinyhumans.tinydesktop.Desktop`, serves the object at
`/ai/tinyhumans/tinydesktop/Desktop`, and provides fifty-four members covering
accessibility-tree observation, ref-addressed interaction, synthesized keyboard
and mouse input, application and window management, the pasteboard,
notifications, waits, and status. Every member takes one request payload — or
none — and returns a `DesktopResponse` envelope carrying either the command's
data or a structured error with its code, suggestion, and recovery hint. All
payload types, the interface name, the object path, and the member names are
published as the `tinydesktop-bus` crate, so a host names them from a library
rather than by string literal.

The module reads its configuration from the loader as a JSON object:
`session_id` and `trace_path` (strings), `trace_strict` and `headed`
(booleans). All are optional.

## Permissions

Desktop automation needs permissions a person grants: accessibility access for
anything that reads or drives another application's tree, and screen recording
for captures. The module checks before it acts, so a missing permission is a
`PERM_DENIED` naming the setting to change rather than an empty tree that looks
like an application with no buttons. Call `Permissions` to read the current
state; it prompts only when explicitly asked to.

macOS and Windows have full accessibility backends. Linux loads and answers but
implements no surfaces yet: observation there fails with
`PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

## Installing

The archive contains one `.so`, `.dylib`, or `.dll` plus `modules.toml`. Keep
those files together when copying them into a TinyBus module directory. The
allowlist binds the native library filename to its SHA-256 digest so TinyBus can
reject a missing, renamed, or modified artifact before initialization.

The GitHub release also publishes `checksum.toml` as a separate asset. TinyBus
checks that manifest before downloading and extracting the selected platform
archive. Install directly from a tagged release with:

```sh
tinybus modules load-github \
  https://github.com/tinyhumansai/tinydesktop/releases/tag/v0.2.1 \
  tinydesktop-0.2.1-ubuntu-24.04-x86_64.tar.gz \
  <archive-sha256>
```

TinyBus modules are trusted in-process code, and this one can read any window on
the machine and drive any application on it. Install release artifacts only from
a trusted source and restart the host after replacing a loaded module.
