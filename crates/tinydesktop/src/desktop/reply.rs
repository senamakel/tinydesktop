//! Turning an engine result into the response envelope.
//!
//! The mapping is deliberately lossless in the direction that matters. An
//! `AppError::Adapter` already carries a code, a platform detail, structured
//! details, and a delivery disposition; those are copied across rather than
//! rendered into the message, because the whole reason the envelope has fields
//! for them is that a caller acts on them. An error of any other shape has only
//! a message and a code, so that is what it becomes.
