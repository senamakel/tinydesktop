//! The engine: one method per member, and the machinery they share.
//!
//! [`Desktop`] is the whole of this crate's behavior. It holds the
//! configuration a command runs under — session identity, tracing, whether
//! physical input is permitted — and exposes one method per member of
//! [`tinydesktop_bus::names::METHODS`]. `tinybus_module` does nothing but adapt
//! those methods to the bus, which is what keeps the feature code testable
//! without a broker.
//!
//! # Why every method returns a response instead of a `Result`
//!
//! A command method returns [`DesktopResponse`] for both outcomes and never
//! fails in the Rust sense. That is deliberate, and it is the same reasoning
//! [`crate::Error`] documents: a stale ref carries a recovery hint, a denied
//! permission carries the setting to change, an ambiguous application name
//! carries the candidates. Those belong in a payload a caller can branch on,
//! not in a `Result::Err` that a bus adapter would flatten to a string.
//!
//! # What happens on each call
//!
//! 1. A platform adapter is constructed. Every adapter is a zero-sized type,
//!    so this costs nothing and avoids holding a platform handle across an
//!    `await` in the bus layer.
//! 2. A [`CommandContext`] is built from this `Desktop`'s configuration. It
//!    carries the session the refs live in and the input policy the command
//!    runs under.
//! 3. The command's [permission need](permission::Need) is checked against the
//!    platform's report, so a command that cannot possibly work fails with
//!    `PERM_DENIED` and the setting to change rather than with whatever the
//!    accessibility API returns for an unauthorized process.
//! 4. The engine runs the command, and its result — value or error — is
//!    wrapped in the envelope.
//!
//! # Files
//!
//! The command methods are split by family across sibling files, each holding
//! one `impl Desktop` block: `observation`, `interaction`, `input`, `apps`,
//! `clipboard`, `notifications`, `waiting`, and `system`. `convert` maps
//! contract payloads onto the engine's argument types, `reply` maps the
//! engine's errors onto the envelope, and `permission` holds the preflight.
